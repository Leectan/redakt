Read workflow_state.md and project_config.md. Read ## CompletionReport and ## Log thoroughly. Review what was implemented in the previous cycle. If more work is needed, write a NEW numbered plan to ## Plan following the format defined in .cursor/rules/strategic-planner.mdc, update ## Context with any new architectural decisions, set Phase to READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION, set Status to PLAN_READY, and increment CycleCount. If all work is complete, set Phase to IDLE, set Status to ALL_WORK_COMPLETE, and archive the current cycle summary to ## ArchiveLog then clear ## Plan, ## Log, and ## CompletionReport for the next cycle.
