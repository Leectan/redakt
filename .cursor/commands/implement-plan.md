Read workflow_state.md in the project root. Check the Phase field under ## State. If Phase is READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION, implement all tasks in ## Plan sequentially. After each task, mark it as [x] in ## Plan and append a timestamped entry to ## Log describing what was done and which files were created or modified. Run relevant tests or linters if they exist. After all tasks are complete, set Phase to VALIDATE under ## State, set Status to IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE, update LastUpdated, and write a detailed ## CompletionReport including files eated, files modified, tests passed, and any deviations from the plan.
If Phase is NOT READY_FOR_IMPLEMENTATION, report the current Phase and Status and instruct the user to switch to GPT 5.2 in the model selector to create a plan first.
